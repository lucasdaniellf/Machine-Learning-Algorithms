Machine Learning Algorithms

These files contain some machine learning algorithms. In all of them I used both the scikit-learn library, from python, and Algorithms I wrote from scratch using machine learning techniques (mainly Gradient Descent). Gradient Descent, although it converges slowly, is still a powerful that gives us a better idea of how machine learning models work.

Some detais that are worth mentioning:
  - The k-means algorithm problem was based on the color quantization one presented in the scikit-learn website: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_color_quantization.html
  - The neural network problem was obtained from the ex4.pdf file that it is also in this repository. I solved this problem also in Octave using Gradient Descent, so I could compare the results at the end.
